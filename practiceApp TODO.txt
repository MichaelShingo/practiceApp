- feedback questions
	- Are there any etudes books you think should be included?

AI 
- Select a technique you want to work on from a list. 
- App sends to AI a list of pieces with that technique that you've already worked on. 
- AI will suggest further practice recommendations. 
- Allow chatting with the AI after this point? (but this could lead to abuse if people just use this as their personal portal)
