- Sends data to AI to provide next practice recommendations
- Provides tutorial videos and recordings
- Can it provide notifications (text or email) about practice reminders, practice inspiration.
- boosted type of feature that times your practice sessions
- can you add notes about your practice to each piece? 
	
AI 
- Select a technique you want to work on from a list. 
- App sends to AI a list of pieces with that technique that you've already worked on. 
- AI will suggest further practice recommendations. 
- Allow chatting with the AI after this point? (but this could lead to abuse if people just use this as their personal portal) 
***************************
Next time you make a component, think about mobile-first design 

global filtering progression
1. filtered pieces changes, useEffect runs - setting global completion 
Category filtering progression
1. Filter applies, filtered pieces changes 
2. useeffect to set Filtered Piece IDS
3. filteredPieceIDS prop changes, use effect, setCount(0) - should masterySum be set here? 
- when you update teh filter, there's something that's just adding strings to the masterySum.....

DATA DASHBOARD
 	- like a github-type calendar that shows days that you completed pieces
		- 365 days in a year, this is the view, always 
		- num of rows are always 7 
		- num of colummns are 53 probably 
		- can you store all the days when you either completed or updated a piece? What if you update a piece multiple times? Isn't that useful information to see? Then set up a new table in database that stores (PieceID, date, updated/created, userID, masteryLVL)
		- You need to create a list of days. Then go through userUpdates object and add that object to the appropriate day in the list. that contains information about what the user did on that day.  Then map the list to the squares component. 
		- When you click on the square, it should show which pieces you updated on that day and the mastery level. 
	- breakdown of composers you've worked on 
	- mastery level of each technique (calculated based on number of pieces you've completed that contain the technique and the mastery level of those pieces)
		- Maintain two maps: (Technique : masterySum and Technique : pieceCount)
		- Calculate teh average within teh masterySum map, then sort them by average mastery 
		- What if you create a custom chart that displays all the techniques X by X and the boxes are filled by the mastery color? 
		- otherwise, you could do this as part of the technique tags. (or display this data in both analytics and main page) 
		- can you incorporate the difficulty level of each of the pieces into the technique mastery calculation? 
	
	
SORTING 
- sort descending and ascending? 
- prevent duplicates based on (pieceID, userID) (BACKEND) 

DEPLOY
- It's basically a working app, can you deploy it so you at least have a react/django app? 

OPTIMIZATIONS
- run compareObj only once when search state updates 
- add more data so you know how it's going to run in reality 
- you'll want to optimize category, so you don't recalculate count every single time you load the app 

DESIGN / LOADING ANIMATIONS
- loading animation for the table and detail dialogue, on first load and on search 
- animation when clicking technique tag 
-  allow background color picker, store dark/light and color in local storage.

BUGS
- It's making a put request to update mastery when you add the piece (after clearing) , but it's not found in the database 



- WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU HAVE THE SAME PAGE OPEN ON MULTIPLE TABS/DEVICES? 


- Do you need to override rest_framework/serializers
